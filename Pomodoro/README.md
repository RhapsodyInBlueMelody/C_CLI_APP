# Welcome to my Pomodoro CLI!!

## Usage

1. Compile the app.c (except if you decided to rename it.. idk)
``` 
  gcc app.c -o <anyoutputname>
```
  
2. Running the cli
```
  ./<anyoutputname>
```

## The reason why i made it ?

Because sometimes i forgot how long i'm study and forgot to take a break. so i made this. Yes.. i know i can just search from google and download the app but where is the fun in that.
